#### Introduction

Hello! I'm Lyagva and I "made" this pack!
Well, actually I wasn't making all gradients. I just used gradients from "uiGradients" collection and then, through
code, made "Eyedrop" styled gradient files.

#### Files
There are some folders:
- .\len16 - gradients with 16 colors 
- .\len8 - gradients with 8 colors

#### How to use
How to use this pack:
1. Open ableton and create midi track 
2. Put some notes or make 1-color animations 
3. Launch "Eyedrop" plugin, switch to "Gradient Edit" tab near "Build Gradient" button 
4. Select midi notes, you want to apply gradient at 
5. Click "Load &
Swap" button above "Gradient Edit" button 
6. Select file:
  7.1. (if you have gradient already applied) Yay!
  7.2. (if gradient didn't applied) switch back on "New Gradient" tab and click "Build Gradient" button


#### Commentary
This pack isn't perfect, because my "Nearest color" system, to replace rgb colors to launchpad velocities is phucing
stupid and simple.
